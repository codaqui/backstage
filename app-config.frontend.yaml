# Frontend-specific configuration for Docker deployment
# This file ensures the frontend uses its own nginx proxy instead of direct backend URLs

app:
  # Frontend is served on port 3000 (mapped to nginx port 80)
  baseUrl: http://localhost:3000

backend:
  # Frontend should make API calls to itself (nginx will proxy)
  # This avoids CORS issues and allows nginx to route to correct backend
  baseUrl: http://localhost:3000
  
  # CORS not needed when frontend proxies through nginx
  cors:
    origin: http://localhost:3000
    methods: [GET, HEAD, PATCH, POST, PUT, DELETE]
    credentials: true
